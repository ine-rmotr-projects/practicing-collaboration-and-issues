# Practicing Collaboration and Issues

For this project, you will be creating Issues within code repositories, tagging and describing some problems in an appropriate fashion. Also, you will be inviting other friends or colleagues to join your code repository to collaborate with you and your code.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
